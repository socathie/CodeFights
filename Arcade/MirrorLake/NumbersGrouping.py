'''You are given an array of integers that you want distribute between several groups. The first group should contain numbers from 1 to 104, the second should contain those from 104 + 1 to 2 * 104, ..., the 100th one should contain numbers from 99 * 104 + 1 to 106 and so on.

All the numbers will then be written down in groups to the text file in such a way that:

the groups go one after another;
each non-empty group has a header which occupies one line;
each number in a group occupies one line.
Calculate how many lines the resulting text file will have.

Example

For a = [20000, 239, 10001, 999999, 10000, 20566, 29999], the output should be
numbersGrouping(a) = 11.

The numbers can be divided into 4 groups:

239 and 10000 go to the 1st group (1 ... 104);
10001 and 20000 go to the second 2nd (104 + 1 ... 2 * 104);
20566 and 29999 go to the 3rd group (2 * 104 + 1 ... 3 * 104);
groups from 4 to 99 are empty;
999999 goes to the 100th group (99 * 104 + 1 ... 106).
Thus, there will be 4 groups (i.e. four headers) and 7 numbers, so the file will occupy 4 + 7 = 11 lines.
